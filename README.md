# FlappyBird Java Game

FlappyBird is a simple 2D arcade game built using Java and Swing. The game involves a bird that needs to navigate through a series of pipes without crashing into them. The goal is to score as many points as possible by passing through the gaps between the pipes.

## Features

- **2D Graphics**: Includes custom images for the bird, pipes, and background.
- **Realistic Physics**: Gravity and velocity are applied to the bird for a more realistic gameplay experience.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, ending the game.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks the score based on how many pipes the bird successfully passes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later).
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, or you can run it from the command line.
